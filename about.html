Asish here. I graduated from the <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a> in 2023, concluding my bachelor's education in Electrical Engineering. Currently, I'm based in Bangalore as a software engineer at Citrix Systems, Inc., and my journey here has been as straight as Sir Ian McKellen.</p>
<p>I was raised in Bhubaneswar, a culturally rich city on the east coast of India. Growing up in an Indian household, I was highly encouraged for scholastic success. I'm thankful to my mother for prioritizing our education despite coming from a family of limited means. I am where I am because of her. While in high school, the small practice of reading and listening to great communicators of the scientific community, like Richard Feynman, instilled in me this curiosity for science, which was enough for that stubborn kid to have sky-high aspirations.</p>
<p>Here are a few highlights from my high school period that I'm proud of; I received the <a href="https://www.indiascienceandtechnology.gov.in/nurturing-minds/scholarships/school/kishore-vaigyanik-protsahan-yojana-kvpy">KVPY</a> fellowship, which is awarded to approximately 3000 students nationwide. I managed to be among the top 10 in the state and top 300 in the country to get selected for the <a href="https://chem.hbcse.tifr.res.in/in-india/">Indian National Chemistry Olympiad</a>. At the end of high school, my performance in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination_%E2%80%93_Advanced">JEE Advanced</a> was good enough to guarantee me a spot at one of the most prestigious institutions in the country.</p>
<p>Forced to trace out my career trajectory years ahead of time, I have to admit, having to decide between pursuing science or engineering was intimidating for me. At IIT Kanpur, I soon realized I wasn't alone in facing such dilemmas about career prospects. Between some great professors, lifelong friendships, and endless self-discovery, those four years were transformative. As an undergrad, I enthusiastically dove into everything in tech, irrespective of their popularity or their technical hardness, with the simple goal of finding what I love. I spent a good chunk of my efforts exploring emerging domains that people only started talking about recently — Quantum Technologies and Neuromorphic Computing, gaining quality experiences from both academic as well as corporate collaborations. In my final year, I made some micro progress working on a research project on brain-inspired hardware and discovered an interesting idea in neuroscience that could be applied to this work. (<em>More details about my experiences in <a href="https://asishmandoi.github.io/cv.pdf">my CV</a></em>)</p>
<p>While IIT Kanpur provided a great environment for me to encounter such opportunities, its rigorous training, which I'm sure my peers would be missing, and my background in Electrical Engineering was the perfect playground for my curiosity. Additionally, I believe, it will make me a good fit for future opportunities.</p>
<p>After a crazy turn of events towards the end of my final year, I was on a flight to Bangalore to begin my professional journey at a cloud computing company as a software engineer. Fast-forward 1.5 years, I've been fortunate to get the chance to contribute to two high-priority projects—plus I finally learnt to hit my chest properly.</p>
<p>I have maintained a five-day workout routine post-work for the past year and a weekly running session, which I find quite liberating. If I find some time and energy in the evening, I try to do some technical reading. Otherwise, I fall asleep while watching something. I'm still trying to revive my childhood knack of drawing.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that our passion, combined with a little faith in the unexpected and maybe a bit of discipline, can lead us to great things. Each of my experiences has shaped my mindset for working towards my goals. I'm glad to have found my calling to explore fascinating areas of Science and Engineering and work on exciting technologies. I will forever be grateful to all the amazing people who have influenced me and helped me grow.</p>
