I’m Asish, a junior undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).

Before joining IIT Kanpur, I was somewhat of a science enthusiast. I used to try to solve challenging physics problems for the sake of fulfillment, and I always found this approach a great way to learn. I remember being particularly excited to learn about the Theory of Relativity and Einstien’s life story. It was one of the first times I elaborately researched a topic because I was so fascinated by it. This experience helped me in a way to get the [KVPY](http://www.kvpy.iisc.ernet.in/main/about.htm) fellowship, and I secured a seat in IISc Bangalore. I also had a strong liking for Chemistry during my high school days. Later, I managed to be among the top 10 in state and top 300 in the country to get selected for [INChO](https://chem.hbcse.tifr.res.in/in-india/).

At the end of high school, fortunately I performed well enough in [JEE Advanced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination_%E2%80%93_Advanced) to get into one of the best institutes in India, but I still had to choose between Science and Engineering. It was indeed an important choice for me, and I still think about it sometimes.

So now I’m a tech enthusiast. I try to engage myself in projects related to something I find particularly interesting. I was working on building a good profile in competitive programming when I got motivated to become involved in the domain of Software Development. My most recent project in the field is the backend development of IITK Coin, a centralized pseudo currency system to be used in IIT Kanpur. I spent a significant amount of time working on quite a few modern web technologies in the project, following good practices.

I have also been actively exploring the field of Quantum Computing, a relatively new and fast-growing field, almost throughout my time as an undergrad. One of the areas I’m interested in is the application of Quantum Computing to solve Optimization Problems efficiently. I am currently working on research projects on Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem using Quantum Annealers and circuit-based Quantum Computers as a part of the [QOSF](https://qosf.org/) community as well as the [QWorld](https://qworld.net/) community.

Apart from being hyped about topics in science and technology, art and film are the two of my favorite things that I enjoy. I have always loved to draw, even as a child. But, I don't get to do much of that now, just once in a while. I also like to spend a part of my leisure watching movies. My fondness for movies comes from the fact that I can appreciate them for their details, hidden meanings, and generally for what an amazing medium of art they are. You can think of me as a movie detective but on a less serious level, if that makes sense.

I firmly believe that our passion combined with ordinary-seeming random events in our life can lead us to great things. I will continue to explore fascinating areas of Science and Engineering, work on exciting technologies. I will always be grateful to all the amazing people who have influenced me in one way or another and helped me grow.
